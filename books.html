                <h5>The Power Of Awareness<h5>
                <p>
                    The power of awareness by Neville Goddard talks about the
                    center of consciousness “I AM” and everything that follows,
                    is created by what “I AM” goes on to create within and how
                    we can change what we have created once we understand how do
                    we go about it.

                <h5>The Law And The Promise<h5>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this book is to show, through actual true
                    stories, how imaging creates reality. The world in which we
                    live is a world of imagination. In fact, life itself is an
                    activity of imagining.

                <h5>Awakened Imagination</h5>
                <p>
                    In Neville Goddard's book Awakened Imagination, readers are
                    introduced to the transformative power of their own thoughts
                    and beliefs. Offering a powerful exploration of how our
                    imaginations can shape our reality, Goddard encourages
                    readers to harness the creative force within them to
                    manifest their desires and dreams.

                <h5>Your Faith Is Your Fortune<h5>
                <p>
                    Neville Goddard's Your Faith is Your Fortune (1941) teaches
                    that our faith in ourselves as God creates our reality.
                    Consciousness precedes all manifestation. Awareness
                    conceived itself as the world through imagination and
                    belief. We decree what appears by the concepts we accept as
                    authentic.

                    Prayer The Art Of Praying</h5>
                
                <p>
                    Neville explains that prayer is not just a religious
                    practice, but a powerful tool for creating one's reality. He
                    emphasizes the importance of having a clear intention,
                    belief, and feeling of already having what one desires while
                    praying.

                <h5>The 7 Day Mental Diet</h5>
                <p>
                    The Seven-Day Mental Diet is about throwing out all
                    negativity and thinking only positive thoughts because, as
                    he says, thoughts are things, or they become things. And if
                    you believe that, it follows that everything in your life
                    today is based on past thoughts you had at some point.

                <h5>Think And Grow Rich<h5>
                <p>
                    This story illustrates Hill's principle of 'Desire: The
                    Starting Point of All Achievement'. The author states that
                    by focusing on a passionate desire, having faith in oneself,
                    training the subconscious to believe in success, and
                    developing a detailed plan, anyone can grow rich.

                <h5>The Miracles Of Your Mind</h5>
                <p>
                    In this work Dr. Joseph Murphy expands on his theory that
                    the latent powers inherent in our subconscious can improve
                    our lives. He discusses the two minds that each of us
                    possess; the objective mind and the subjective mind, and how
                    to integrate them.
