                A Place To Log Your Manifestation</h2>
               <h3> Enter your manifestations below and let your subconscious mind do the work! <h3>
                <p>Write them in the present or past tense as if they have already
                happened, such as "I had an amazing day" or "I achieved my dream
                to be an entrepreneur"</p>
                Once these things happen in your three-dimensional reality,
                click the checkbox at the left side of your desire to indicate that your
                manifestation has been received. <br />You can write small
                manifestations like "I received a free cup of coffee" or big
                ones like "I have over X grand in my bank account."<br> Example
                Manifestations: I received a free cup of coffee. <br>I had an
                amazing day.<br> I achieved my dream of becoming a doctor. I got
                over X grand of money in my bank account. <br>Feel free to add your
                own and look back in awe! <br />
