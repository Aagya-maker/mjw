            <p class="lead">
                Enter your manifestations below and let your subconscious mind
                do the work!
            </p>
            <p>
                Write them in the present or past tense as if they have already
                happened, such as "I had an amazing day" or "I achieved my dream
                to be an entrepreneur".
            </p>
            <p>
                Once these things happen in your three-dimensional reality,
                click the checkbox at the left side of your desire to indicate
                that your manifestation has been received.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can write small manifestations like "I received a free cup
                of coffee" or big ones like "I have over X grand in my bank
                account."
            </p>
            <h3>Example Manifestations:</h3>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>I received a free cup of coffee.</li>
                <li>I had an amazing day.</li>
                <li>I achieved my dream of becoming a doctor.</li>
                <li>I got over X grand of money in my bank account.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Feel free to add your own and look back in awe!</b></p>
